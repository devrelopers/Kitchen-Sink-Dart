# Dart Kitchen Sink

A comprehensive demonstration of Dart language features, showcasing everything the language has to offer in a single, well-documented file.

## Overview

`KitchenSink.dart` is an educational resource that demonstrates all major Dart language features with practical examples and detailed comments. This file serves as both a reference guide and a learning tool for developers at all levels.

## Features Demonstrated

### Core Language Features
- **Variables & Data Types**: Constants, finals, late initialization, null safety, type inference
- **Collections**: Lists, Sets, Maps, and their operations
- **Functions**: Basic functions, arrow syntax, optional/named parameters, higher-order functions, generators
- **Control Flow**: If/else, switch expressions, loops, assertions
- **Classes & OOP**: Constructors, inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, mixins, extensions
- **Generics**: Generic classes, functions, and constraints
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch/finally, custom exceptions, error propagation

### Modern Dart Features (3.0+)
- **Patterns & Pattern Matching**: Destructuring, pattern switches, guards
- **Records**: Tuples with positional and named fields
- **Sealed Classes**: Exhaustive pattern matching for class hierarchies
- **Enhanced Enums**: Enums with members, methods, and mixins

### Advanced Concepts
- **Asynchronous Programming**: async/await, Futures, Streams, StreamControllers
- **Isolates**: Concurrent execution and message passing
- **Metadata & Annotations**: Custom annotations and built-in decorators
- **Type Aliases**: Typedefs for function signatures and complex types
- **Platform Features**: Environment variables, URIs, DateTime, RegExp
- **Zones**: Error handling contexts and zone-local values

## Usage

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Run without arguments
dart KitchenSink.dart

# Run with command-line arguments
dart KitchenSink.dart arg1 arg2 arg3
```

### As a Reference

Each section in the file is clearly marked with headers and contains:
- Conceptual explanation comments
- Practical code examples
- Best practices and usage notes
- Common patterns and idioms

## Code Organization

The file is organized into logical sections:

1. **Imports and Libraries** - Standard library imports
2. **Variables and Data Types** - Type system demonstration
3. **Collections** - Lists, Sets, Maps operations
4. **Functions** - Function types and features
5. **Control Flow** - Conditional and iterative constructs
6. **Classes and Objects** - OOP concepts
7. **Generics** - Type parameterization
8. **Asynchronous Programming** - Concurrent operations
9. **Error Handling** - Exception management
10. **Modern Features** - Latest Dart 3.0+ capabilities
11. **Platform Integration** - System interaction

## Key Learning Points

### Null Safety
Dart's sound null safety helps prevent null reference errors:
```dart
String? nullableString;  // Can be null
String nonNullString = 'Cannot be null';
```

### Pattern Matching
Powerful pattern matching for cleaner code:
```dart
var result = switch (value) {
  < 0 => 'Negative',
  0 => 'Zero',
  > 0 => 'Positive',
};
```

### Async Programming
Built-in support for asynchronous operations:
```dart
Future<String> fetchData() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  return 'Data loaded';
}
```

### Mixins
Composition over inheritance:
```dart
class Duck extends Animal with Flyable, Swimmable {
  // Combines multiple behaviors
}
```

## Requirements

- Dart SDK 3.0 or higher
- No external dependencies required

## Educational Value

This kitchen sink demonstration is perfect for:
- **Beginners**: Learning Dart syntax and concepts
- **Intermediate Developers**: Understanding advanced features
- **Experienced Developers**: Quick reference for Dart capabilities
- **Teams**: Establishing coding patterns and best practices
